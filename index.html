                    I am Gaurav, a 24 years old aspiring <em>Backend Developer</em> from Punjab, India. The world of
                    coding has always amazed me and for a long time i wanted to learn to code, But it was not until this
                    year that actually started learning to code. As i continued to learn different languages and
                    technologies, my interest in tech grew with time. I started to learn to code in May and from that
                    time forward whatever i have done and learned along the way, this is the record of it, a portfolio.

                        blogs. It was an interesting project as I learned many things, such as authentication and

                    <h2>Open to Interns</h2>
                    <p>Let's assume that in a College there are many students who wants to get internships and then
                        there are the employers who wants to hire those iterns. But the problem is they don't have
                        mutual ground where they can meet. This backend solves this very problem. We ask students for
                        their college name. Employers can search for the Interns why the abbreviation of the college,
                        whose students they wants to hire. Kind of how <em>internshala</em> works.</p>

                    <p>In this project, i created the backend part of a book management website. There are multiple
                        users who needs to register on the website, upon registering on the site, they need to
                        successfully login as well. Once the user is logged in, he can register for the books he wants
                        under his profile. Other's can see his books and leave a review. An author can delete his own
                        books or update them.Kind of like <em>Goodreads.</em> </p>

                    <p>Have you ever needed to share a url of a particular website or a post. But copying long url
                        neither looks cool nor are good to work with specially if you are in hurry. The longer a url is
                        the more problems could arise and it does not give a good user experience either. So I created a
                        url shortner, based on <em>bitly</em>. Optimized with <em>Redis Storage</em> </p>

                        instructed to move to next Feature. In this project we are changing how we send token with a
                        request. Instead of using a custom header key like x-api-key, you need to use Authorization
                        header and send the JWT token as Bearer token. </p>
